Two small carts, 1 and 2, are on a nearly frictionless track connected smoothly to a frictionless hill. Cart 1 weighs m_1 = \,\mathrm{kg} and Cart 2 weighs m_2 = \,\mathrm{kg} . Cart 1 was moving with velocity v_0 to the left, before it struck cart 2 which was initially stationary. After the collision, cart 1 continues to move in the same direction with velocity v_1 = \,\mathrm{m/s}. With what velocity v_0 was Cart 1 moving before the collision, if the collision is instantaneous and cart 2 reaches a height of h = \,\mathrm{m}?
